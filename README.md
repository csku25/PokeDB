# PokeDB
- Asynchronous Pokemon Database Server and Client
- All written in Go
- Database isn't actually valid, just CSV I converted to (a quite large) binary
## Background
This was a project I accumulated and submitted as my final for a
grad level course. Please, seriously, give the most raw criticism.
